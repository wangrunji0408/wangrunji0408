I'm a system developer and Rustacean.

I built **operating systems** in Rust:
- [rCore]: A Linux-compatible OS kernel for teaching. (2018-2019)
- [zCore]: A reimplementation of [Zircon] microkernel in Rust. (2020)
- [Occlum]: A multi-process library OS for Intel SGX. (2019)

I also built **storage systems** in Rust:
- MadFS: A benchmark-oriented distributed file system once ranked #1 on the [IO500] list. (2020)
- MadFSv2: A more "serious" distributed file system but rarely works. (2021-2022)

I was interested in building robust **distributed systems** in Rust:
- [Madsim]: A FoundationDB-style deterministic simulation framework in Rust. (2021-2022)

Iâ€™m currently working on building **database systems** and **streaming systems** in Rust:
- [RisingLight]: An OLAP database system for educational purpose. (2021-now)
- [RisingWave]: A distributed SQL streaming database in the cloud. (2022-now)
