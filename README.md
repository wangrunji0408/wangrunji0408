I built **operating systems** in Rust:
- [rCore]: A Linux-compatible kernel for OS teaching. (2018-2019)
- [zCore]: A reimplementation of [Zircon] microkernel in Rust. (2020)
- [Occlum]: A multi-process library OS for Intel SGX. (2019)

I also built **storage systems** in Rust:
- MadFS: A benchmark-oriented burst buffer file system for [IO500]. (2020)
- MadFSv2: A more "serious" distributed file system but rarely works. (2021-2022)

I'm interested in building **distributed systems** in Rust:
- [Madsim]: A FoundationDB-style deterministic simulation framework in Rust. (2021-now)

Iâ€™m currently working on building **database systems** in Rust:
- [RisingLight]: An OLAP database system for educational purpose. (2021-now)
- [RisingWave]: A next-generation streaming database in the cloud. (2022-now)
